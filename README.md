## Opinionated template for cosmos blockchains

Nursery is a cosmos blockchain template that stays up to date with the Cosmos ecosystem.  


## Why?

Most cosmos chains are mainly the same under the hood.  Nursery aims to standardize that even further, so that developers can focus on adding new features, instead of rote maintenance.
